# Hospital Ranking Scraper
## Project Overview
This repository contains the code for a web scraping project developed during my role as a Research Assistant. The primary objective of this project is to assist a professor in gathering information about the hierarchical classification of hospitals across China.

# Files
- hospital_level.py: This is the main script of the web scraping tool. It is designed to automatically scrape data about hospital rankings from specified sources.
- hospital_search.csv: This file contains the results of the scraping process. It lists hospitals along with their respective rankings and other relevant details as obtained from the web.

# Data Privacy
Due to the sensitive nature of the source documents and the privacy concerns regarding the data, the original documents used for scraping have not been uploaded to this repository.
